      Bill Griffiths was one of the most important avant-garde poets working in Britain in the second half of the twentieth century. For a while he was both a rider with the Hells Angels in Harrow and a worker in the print room of the Poetry Society. In a similarly vertiginous balancing act, his poetry combines quick-witted playfulness and an uncompromising rejection of injustice. In addition to his work as a poet, he ran a small press, putting out his own work and that of others. Born in Middlesex, he lived in a house boat for some years and later settled in Seaham in Durham, where he meticulously recorded the local dialect, as well as the specialised vocabularies of miners and fishers.
